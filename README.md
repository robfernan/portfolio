# Portfolio (Robert Fernandez)

This repository contains a personal portfolio website and related project sources maintained by Robert Fernandez. The site showcases game development, tools, and projects built with frameworks like SFML, Love2D, and modern web tooling. It also contains a nested project, `src/aviationpro`, which is an airplane utility app included as a regular directory.

## Main Pages & Features

- **PortfolioHome** (Home Page):
  - Landing page with about, skills, featured work, and a detailed timeline of my journey and achievements.
- **Projects**:
  - Showcases a collection of my software, games, and creative coding projects.
- **Art**:
  - Gallery of digital art, game art, and creative works.
- **AviationPro** (Aviation):
  - Dedicated section for my all-in-one pilot app, AviationPro, with features, screenshots, and details.

## What this repo is for

- Host a living snapshot of Robert's portfolio website and project assets.
- Provide source for the web UI (Vite + React/TypeScript + Tailwind CSS) and supporting media assets.
- Include the `AviationPro` app sources under `src/aviationpro` for reference and development.

## Technologies

- Vite
- React (TypeScript / .tsx files)
- Tailwind CSS, PostCSS
- Static assets served from `public/`

## Repo layout (quick)

- `public/` — images and static assets used by the site.
- `src/` — primary site source files (React components, styles, entry points).
- `src/aviationpro/` — an included application (full project) related to AviationPro.
- `.gitignore` — common ignores for node artifacts and IDE files.

## Development (local)

You need Node.js and npm installed. From the repository root (PowerShell example):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\User\Documents\Bolt_ai\portfolio"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Typical npm scripts (if present) you'll find in `package.json`:
- `dev` — start development server
- `build` — build for production
- `preview` — preview built output locally

## Notes and suggestions

- Large binary assets are included under `public/assets`; consider moving large or build-only assets to a release or separate storage if the repo grows.
- If you plan to publish GitHub Pages via `gh-pages`, add a deploy step or use the Vercel/Netlify auto-deploy for the `main` branch.
- `src/aviationpro` is a full project; open it separately if you want to run or maintain it as a standalone app.

## License

Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to specify terms. Currently no explicit license is included in this snapshot.
